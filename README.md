# Learning Notes

My personal knowledge base for programming concepts and technologies. I commit notes here daily as part of my continuous learning routine.

## Contents

**C# & .NET**

- [C Sharp.md](dotnet/C%20Sharp.md) - Complete C# guide 
- [ADO.NET.md](dotnet/ADO.NET.md) - Database integration with ADO.NET 
- [ASP.NET.md](dotnet/ASP.NET.md) - Web Forms development

**Version Control**

- [Git.md](git/Git.md) - Git internals, workflows & team collaboration
- [GitHub.md](git/GitHub.md) - GitHub features & workflows

Additional topics will be added as I expand into new areas.

## Approach

I'm documenting what I learn to reinforce concepts and build a reference I can revisit. These notes capture my understanding at different points in my learning journey - they're practical, not academic.

## Tools & Workflow

- **Obsidian** for markdown-based note-taking with linking between concepts
- **Git** for version control and tracking progress over time
- Regular commits to maintain consistency
