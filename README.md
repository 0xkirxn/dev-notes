# Learning Notes

My personal knowledge base for programming concepts and technologies. I commit notes here daily as part of my continuous learning routine.

## Contents

**C# & .NET**

- Language fundamentals and advanced features
- Object-oriented design principles
- Common patterns and best practices

Additional topics will be added as I expand into new areas.

## Approach

I'm documenting what I learn to reinforce concepts and build a reference I can revisit. These notes capture my understanding at different points in my learning journey - they're practical, not academic.

## Tools & Workflow

- **Obsidian** for markdown-based note-taking with linking between concepts
- **Git** for version control and tracking progress over time
- Regular commits to maintain consistency
